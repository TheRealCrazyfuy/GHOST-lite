# GHOST lite

Simple winform roblox executor with fluxus api. Dont expect any updates on it. You can use it to learn or skid it i dont mind

If you want a multi api executor that gets updates you should try [GHOST](https://github.com/TheRealCrazyfuy/GHOST-bootstrapper/releases), it also installs GHOST lite so you have both of them.
